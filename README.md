## Overview


## My process
I started by creating a container div in which i uploaded the qr code image, i added another div below the img element and used h4 and p for the texts. I then used CSS to give it the appropriate design, i followed a mobile first approach and then used media query to make it responsive. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- media query

### What I learned

I"m especially excited about learning how to upload images to my code when the images are in the same folder and when it's not. I also got to experiment with media queries and got a better understanding of how it works.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still a bit confused about media queries when it involves using it on more complicated responsive web designs, i got to experiment a little but i'm definitely focusing more on that in my future projects.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource](https://w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me understand a lot about what each and every html and css element are used for. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
